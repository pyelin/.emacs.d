# Pye's Emacs Configuration

## Setup

To setup, start with a blank emacs and clone this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:pyephyomaung/.emacs.d.git

Then add this to your .emacs:

    (load-file "<PATH_TO_REPOSITORY/init.el")


## Keybinding: hydra-invoker

The key binding is optimized for Dvorak keyboard. It is based on vim-like modal editing and invoking commands by combining 3 keys based on Dota 2 invoker.
